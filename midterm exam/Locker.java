/**
* The program below, while has the correct output, doesn't follow the gameâ€™s logic at all.
* Instead, it follows a certain pattern that's present in the game.
* Consider the 100th locker. Following the games rules, this locker should be visited by the 1st, 2nd,
* 3rd, 4th, 5th, 10th, 20th, 25th, 50th, and 100th student. Coincidentally, these are also the positive
* divisors of 100. Similarly, the 30th locker is visited by the students whose numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 
* 6, 10, 15, and 30. Note that if the numbers of positive divisors of a locker number is odd, then at
* the end of the game, the locker is open. if the numbers of positive divisors of a locker number is 
* even, then at the end of the game, the locker is closed.
